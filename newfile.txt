Difference of add, commit and push is that,
"add" is use to stage any unstage files/changes you did in your repository that you are about to commit.
"commit" is commiting file to your local repository does other people who have cloned that repository cannot see it your updated files/changes.
"push" is use to apply your files/changes to the origin so other people who cloned that repository will be able to see and base to the files/changes you have done by pulling the repo.
